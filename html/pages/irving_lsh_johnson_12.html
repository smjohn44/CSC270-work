			<div class="cts_corpus"><div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">71</span><span class="cts_passage"> It is true, an old farmer, who had been down to New York on a visit several years after, and from whom this account of the ghostly adventure was received, brought home the intelligence that Ichabod Crane was still alive; that he had left the neighborhood partly through fear of the goblin and Hans Van Ripper, and partly in mortification at having been suddenly dismissed by the heiress; that he had changed his quarters to a distant part of the country; had kept school and studied law at the same time; had been admitted to the bar; turned politician; electioneered; written for the newspapers; and finally had been made a justice of the Ten Pound Court. Brom Bones, too, who, shortly after his rival’s disappearance conducted the blooming Katrina in triumph to the altar, was observed to look exceedingly knowing whenever the story of Ichabod was related, and always burst into a hearty laugh at the mention of the pumpkin; which led some to suspect that he knew more about the matter than he chose to tell.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">72</span><span class="cts_passage"> The old country wives, however, who are the best judges of these matters, maintain to this day that Ichabod was spirited away by supernatural means; and it is a favorite story often told about the neighborhood round the winter evening fire. The bridge became more than ever an object of superstitious awe; and that may be the reason why the road has been altered of late years, so as to approach the church by the border of the millpond. The schoolhouse being deserted soon fell to decay, and was reported to be haunted by the ghost of the unfortunate pedagogue and the plowboy, loitering homeward of a still summer evening, has often fancied his voice at a distance, chanting a melancholy psalm tune among the tranquil solitudes of Sleepy Hollow.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">73</span><span class="cts_passage"> POSTSCRIPT.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">74</span><span class="cts_passage"> FOUND IN THE HANDWRITING OF MR. KNICKERBOCKER.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">75</span><span class="cts_passage"> The preceding tale is given almost in the precise words in which I heard it related at a Corporation meeting at the ancient city of Manhattoes, at which were present many of its sagest and most illustrious burghers. The narrator was a pleasant, shabby, gentlemanly old fellow, in pepper-and-salt clothes, with a sadly humourous face, and one whom I strongly suspected of being poor--he made such efforts to be entertaining. When his story was concluded, there was much laughter and approbation, particularly from two or three deputy aldermen, who had been asleep the greater part of the time. There was, however, one tall, dry-looking old gentleman, with beetling eyebrows, who maintained a grave and rather severe face throughout, now and then folding his arms, inclining his head, and looking down upon the floor, as if turning a doubt over in his mind. He was one of your wary men, who never laugh but upon good grounds--when they have reason and law on their side. When the mirth of the rest of the company had subsided, and silence was restored, he leaned one arm on the elbow of his chair, and sticking the other akimbo, demanded, with a slight, but exceedingly sage motion of the head, and contraction of the brow, what was the moral of the story, and what it went to prove?</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">76</span><span class="cts_passage"> The story-teller, who was just putting a glass of wine to his lips, as a refreshment after his toils, paused for a moment, looked at his inquirer with an air of infinite deference, and, lowering the glass slowly to the table, observed that the story was intended most logically to prove--</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">77</span><span class="cts_passage"> “That there is no situation in life but has its advantages and pleasures--provided we will but take a joke as we find it:</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">78</span><span class="cts_passage"> “That, therefore, he that runs races with goblin troopers is likely to have rough riding of it.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">79</span><span class="cts_passage"> “Ergo, for a country schoolmaster to be refused the hand of a Dutch heiress is a certain step to high preferment in the state.”</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">80</span><span class="cts_passage"> The cautious old gentleman knit his brows tenfold closer after this explanation, being sorely puzzled by the ratiocination of the syllogism, while, methought, the one in pepper-and-salt eyed him with something of a triumphant leer. At length he observed that all this was very well, but still he thought the story a little on the extravagant--there were one or two points on which he had his doubts.</span></div>
<div class="cts_node"><span class="cts_ref">81</span><span class="cts_passage"> “Faith, sir,” replied the story-teller, “as to that matter, I don’t believe one-half of it myself.”  D. K.</span></div></div>
